# Moving From Github to Azure DevOps

git remote -v         # to check remote of repo it will have fetch and pull link and both are same
git pull              # to pull all latest data
git remote rm origin  # to remove origin
git remote -v         # now we will check remote origin link but they are not there


Now add this one to Azure

git remote add origin https://.............  # this can be download from first page of Azure Devops Project page
git push -u origin --all   # this command will push this repo to Az DevOps, where -u means upstarem and --all means with all branches

Now we can see repo and all older commits to.

Now we have code on GitHub as well since we have not delete repo from there as we have only disconnected.
